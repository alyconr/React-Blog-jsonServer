## Introduction

The main goal of the React Blog with JSON Server project is to help you learn how to build a blog application using React and other essential technologies. In the process, you will gain experience in:

- Utilizing React hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect` to manage component state and side effects.
- Using `useParams` from React Router to access dynamic route parameters.
- Handling user interactions and events within React components.
- Managing component props and reusing components to maintain a modular and efficient codebase.
- Implementing client-side routing with `react-router-dom`.
- Making HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to a JSON Server to create, read, update, and delete blog posts.

## Features

Here are some of the key features of the Alyconr React Blog:

- View a list of all blog posts.
- Click on a blog post to view its details.
- Create a new blog post.
- Edit an existing blog post.
- Delete a blog post.
- Dynamic routing using React Router to display individual blog posts.
- State management for managing blog data and form input using React hooks.
- Reusable components for a maintainable codebase.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your development machine:

- Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the Alyconr React Blog project:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-blog-jsonserver.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `react-blog-jsonserver` directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-blog-jsonserver
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```
5. In a new terminal window, navigate to the `react-blog-jsonserver` directory:

   ```bash
   cd react-blog-jsonserver
   ```
6. The application should now be running locally. Open your web browser and access the following URL:

   ```bash
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
You're all set! You can now explore and interact with the Alyconr React Blog application.

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can do the following:

- View a list of all blog posts.
- Click on a blog post to view its details.
- Create a new blog post.
- Edit an existing blog post.
- Delete a blog post.

Feel free to explore the code to understand how different features are implemented, including state management, routing, and making HTTP requests to the JSON Server.
